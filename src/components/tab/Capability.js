      "Some electrochemical sensors (NO, NH3) require a bias voltage to detect the gas, while most do not. Biased sensors require an equilibration time (also known as warm-up time) at least 6 hours after installation for the baseline to become stable enough to calibrate the sensor. Once installed, any sensor bias stays on, even when the meter is off. Therefore, even biased sensors are ready for immediate use when the instrument is turned on again, and the equilibration time is needed only when first installed or if the battery becomes completely drained.",
