      "All calibration gases are considered hazardous materials. Ensure the location chosen for bump testing has adequate ventilation. ",
    bullet02:
      "If exposure to contaminated materials is suspected, seek medical attention immediately.",
    bullet03:
      "Do not charge lithium-ion batteries in extreme heat conditions due to the risk of fire or explosion.",
    bullet04: "Do not remove or install battery in a hazardous environment.",

    bullet01:
      "Make sure to wear nitrile gloves to prevent sensor contamination. Do not touch the photo ionization detector (PID) lamp window with bare fingers because the residual oils left behind will shorten the lamp's operating life.",
    bullet02:
      "When inserting sensor into sensor conditioner socket, never  press down on top of sensor.",
    bullet03:
      "Ensure sensor alignment keys are properly aligned with the sensor socket alignment slots before attempting to seat the sensor.",

    content: "",
    bullet01:
      "New sensorâ€™s must be given enough time to properly condition, or erratic readings will be obtained. Electrochemical sensors require a minimum of six hours to achieve the required stabilization.",
    bullet02:
      "The gas and toxic industrial chemicals (TIC) monitors are configured to use only specific sensors in order to reduce the risk of cross sensitivity. Using a sensor that is not designed for use in a specific monitor could cause erratic or erroneous readings by the detector. Using a sensor that is not designed for use in a specific monitor could cause erractic or erroneous readings by the detector.",

      "Both the TIC Vapor Detector and the Gas Monitor operate by catalytic combustion.",
    bullet01:
      "When utilizing the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) sensor, the sample is drawn across a surface of heated platinum connected to an electrical circuit (Wheatstone Bridge).",
    bullet02:
      "If the sample is flammable, it will burn on the platinum catalyst thus producing heat in direct proportion to the concentration of combustible gas present.",

      "When utilizing the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) sensor, the sample is drawn across a surface of heated platinum connected to an electrical circuit (Wheatstone Bridge).",
    bullet04:
      "Ions are collected, amplified, and produce a current which is read on the display screen as total organic vapors present (in ppb).",
